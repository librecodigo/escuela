## Guia Para Contribuir [Espa침ol] (Se Viene Pronto!)

## Contribution Guidelines [English]

Hello. 游녦

C칩digo is possible thanks to kind volunteers like you. We are grateful for your contributions and are excited to welcome you aboard.

We strictly enforce our ["Code of Conduct"](coming soon!). Please take a moment to read it.

Happy contributing.

## Here are some fun ways that you can help

You can contribute to any of these:

1. [Contribute to this open-source codebase](#contribute-to-this-open-source-codebase). Help us edit coding challenges, or fix bugs on the learning platform.

2. [Help with translation fixes](#help-with-translation-fixes) as we integrate the Spanish curriculum on the website.

## Contribute to this open-source codebase

Right now, we are looking for help with UI - especially for toggling between Spanish and English lessons. If you are interested in helping, send an email to jess@codigo.la and I will add you to the organization!

### Create, update and fix bugs

Once you are a part of the c칩digo github organization, you can create pull requests, host the platform locally, and add any contributions you'd like!

### Help us fix bugs in C칩digo's learning platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools, and libraries, including but not limited to, Node.js, MongoDB, LoopBack, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly,

- We have a Node.js based API server.
- A set of React-based client applications.
- A script that we use to evaluate our front-end projects.

Contributing to this requires some understanding of APIs, ES6 Syntax, and a lot of curiosity.

Essentially, we expect basic familiarity with some of the aforementioned technologies, tools, and libraries. With that being said, you are not required to be an expert on them to contribute.

**If you want to help us improve our codebase, you can [set up this repo (originally forked from FreeCodeCamp) locally](/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I found a typo, should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without first creating an issue. Issues are more for discussing larger problems associated with code or structural aspects of the curriculum.

### How do I get an issue assigned to me?

We typically do not assign issues to anyone other than long-time contributors to avoid ambiguous no-shows. Instead, we follow the below policy to be fair to everyone:

1. The first pull-request for any issue is preferred to be merged.
2. In the case of multiple pull-requests for the same issue, we give priority to the quality of the code in the pull-requests. 
   - Did you include tests? 
   - Did you catch all use-cases?
   - Did you ensure all tests pass, and you confirmed everything works locally?
3. Finally, we favor pull-requests which follow our recommended guidelines. 
   - Did you follow the pull-request checklist? 
   - Did you name your pull-request title meaningfully?

You do not need any permission for issues that are marked `help wanted` or `first timers welcome` as explained earlier. Follow the guidelines carefully and open a pull-request.

### I am new to GitHub and Open Source, where should I start?
