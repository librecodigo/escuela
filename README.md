### Certifications

Código offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginning programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 30 projects in the Código curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

Once you’ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](coming soon). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.
